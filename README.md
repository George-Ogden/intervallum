This library is usable, tested and documented, however it only works on integers (`i8`-`i64`, `u8`-`u64`, `usize` and `isize`) and only a few operations are implemented. For generic purposes, common operations on collections are extracted into traits.

Examples and more in the [documentation](http://hyc.io/intervallum)
