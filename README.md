This library is usable, tested and documented, however it only works on integers (`i8`-`u64`, `u8`-`u64`, `usize` and `isize`) and only a few operations are implemented. For generic purposes we extracted common operations on collections into traits.

Examples and more in the [documentation](http://www.rust-ci.org/ptal/rust-interval/doc/interval/)
