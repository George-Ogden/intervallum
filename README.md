Compiled on the nightly channel of Rust. Use [rustup](www.rustup.rs) for managing compiler channels. Download the exact same version of the compiler used with `rustup override add nightly-2016-04-05`.

This library is usable, tested and documented, however it only works on integers (`i8`-`i64`, `u8`-`u64`, `usize` and `isize`) and only a few operations are implemented.

Examples and more in the [documentation](http://hyc.io/intervallum).
