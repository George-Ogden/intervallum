Interval Arithmetic Library
===========================

This library is usable, tested and documented, however it only works on integers (`i8`-`u64`, `u8`-`u64`, `usize` and `isize`) and only a few operations are implemented. For generic purposes we extracted common operations on collections (union, cardinality, ...) into traits.

See the github issues to see the work remaining and feel free to send your PR.
